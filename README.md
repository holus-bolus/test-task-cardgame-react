# React Blackjack Game

This project is a simple implementation of Blackjack (also known as 21), built with React. The game is played against a dealer. The player can draw cards (hit) until they want to stop (stay) or until they exceed 21 (bust). The dealer will draw cards until they have at least 17. The player wins if their hand value is higher than the dealer's or if the dealer busts.
